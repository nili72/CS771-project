# Latent Diffusion for Scalable Generation of Electron Microscopy Image-Mask Pairs
CS771-project

This is the Mask-R-CNN evaluation part for defect detection and segmentation. The Mask R-CNN model has been trained on 2 different datasets with 4000 of 256 Ã— 256 images in each dataset, with one composed of real images and another of synthetic images. The test dataset is 550 real images of the same size to test both real-image-trained model (code/output/aug_real) and synthetic-image-trained model (code/output/aug_unet). The results and some predicted samples are in the output folder

Due to the the space limitation of GitHub, the dataset and weights can be found at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14691207.v
