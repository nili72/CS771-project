Error in ConvexHull computation for image 0501_300kx_1nm_clhaadf3_0014_24: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 192326011  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  3  Error-roundoff 7.7e-14  _one-merge 3.9e-13
  _near-inside 1.9e-12  Visible-distance 1.5e-13  U-max-coplanar 1.5e-13
  Width-outside 3.1e-13  _wide-facet 9.3e-13  _maxoutside 4.6e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 1.1e+02     0
- p2(v2): 1.2e+02     0
- p0(v1): 1.1e+02     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 7.7e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    113.7        0

facet p2 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p2 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       112       115  difference=    3
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 7.7e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image 2501_300kx_1nm_clhaadf3_0034_8: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 193788220  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  6  Error-roundoff 5.1e-14  _one-merge 2.5e-13
  _near-inside 1.3e-12  Visible-distance 1e-13  U-max-coplanar 1e-13
  Width-outside 2e-13  _wide-facet 6.1e-13  _maxoutside 3.1e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3):    72     0
- p3(v2):    76     0
- p0(v1):    70     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 5.1e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    72.67        0

facet p3 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p3 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:        70        76  difference=    6
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 5.1e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image 2501_300kx_1nm_clhaadf3_0038_6: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 194410079  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  5  Error-roundoff 5.3e-14  _one-merge 2.6e-13
  _near-inside 1.3e-12  Visible-distance 1.1e-13  U-max-coplanar 1.1e-13
  Width-outside 2.1e-13  _wide-facet 6.4e-13  _maxoutside 3.2e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3):    75     0
- p5(v2):    79     0
- p0(v1):    74     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 5.3e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point       76        0

facet p5 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p5 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:        74        79  difference=    5
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 5.3e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image grid1_roi1_500kx_0p5nm_haadf1_0007_15: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 201838773  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width 18  Error-roundoff 1.1e-13  _one-merge 5.4e-13
  _near-inside 2.7e-12  Visible-distance 2.1e-13  U-max-coplanar 2.1e-13
  Width-outside 4.3e-13  _wide-facet 1.3e-12  _maxoutside 6.4e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 1.4e+02     0
- p18(v2): 1.6e+02     0
- p0(v1): 1.4e+02     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 1.1e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    148.3        0

facet p18 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p18 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       142       160  difference=   18
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 1.1e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image grid1_roi1_500kx_0p5nm_haadf1_0007_15: QH6013 qhull input error: input is less than 2-dimensional since all points have the same x coordinate    0

Error in ConvexHull computation for image grid1_roi1_500kx_0p5nm_haadf1_0015_17: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 202763158  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  6  Error-roundoff 6.7e-14  _one-merge 3.4e-13

  Width-outside 2.7e-13  _wide-facet 8e-13  _maxoutside 4e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3):    95     0
- p6(v2): 1e+02     0
- p0(v1):    94     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 6.7e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    96.33        0

facet p6 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p6 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:        94       100  difference=    6
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 6.7e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image grid1_roi2_500kx_0p5nm_haadf1_0051_13: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 204326209  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  3  Error-roundoff 4.4e-14  _one-merge 2.2e-13

  Width-outside 1.7e-13  _wide-facet 5.2e-13  _maxoutside 2.6e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3):    63     0
- p3(v2):    65     0
- p0(v1):    62     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 4.4e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    63.33        0

facet p3 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p3 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:        62        65  difference=    3
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 4.4e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image grid1_roi2_500kx_0p5nm_haadf1_0063_5: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 1.5e+02 2.6e+02
- p7(v2): 1.5e+02 2.6e+02
- p0(v1): 1.5e+02 2.6e+02

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 2.2e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    149.7      255

facet p1 p7 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       147       154  difference=    7
  1:       255       255  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 2.2e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image map1_70kx_onzap_CL4100_1: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 206813645  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  2  Error-roundoff 2.2e-13  _one-merge 1.1e-12
  _near-inside 5.5e-12  Visible-distance 4.4e-13  U-max-coplanar 4.4e-13
  Width-outside 8.7e-13  _wide-facet 2.6e-12  _maxoutside 1.3e-12

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 2.5e+02 2.6e+02
- p2(v2): 2.5e+02 2.6e+02
- p0(v1): 2.5e+02 2.6e+02

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 2.2e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point      251      255

facet p2 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p2 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       250       252  difference=    2
  1:       255       255  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 2.2e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image map1_70kx_onzap_CL4100_19: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 207183399  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum

  Width-outside 4.6e-13  _wide-facet 1.4e-12  _maxoutside 6.9e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 1.7e+02     0
- p7(v2): 1.7e+02     0
- p0(v1): 1.6e+02     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 1.2e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    167.7        0

facet p7 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p7 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       165       172  difference=    7
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 1.2e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image 0501_300kx_1nm_clhaadf3_0014_24: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 209637221  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  3  Error-roundoff 7.7e-14  _one-merge 3.9e-13
  _near-inside 1.9e-12  Visible-distance 1.5e-13  U-max-coplanar 1.5e-13
  Width-outside 3.1e-13  _wide-facet 9.3e-13  _maxoutside 4.6e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 1.1e+02     0
- p2(v2): 1.2e+02     0
- p0(v1): 1.1e+02     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 7.7e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    113.7        0

facet p2 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p2 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       112       115  difference=    3
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 7.7e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image 2501_300kx_1nm_clhaadf3_0034_8: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 211015395  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  6  Error-roundoff 5.1e-14  _one-merge 2.5e-13
  _near-inside 1.3e-12  Visible-distance 1e-13  U-max-coplanar 1e-13
  Width-outside 2e-13  _wide-facet 6.1e-13  _maxoutside 3.1e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3):    72     0
- p3(v2):    76     0
- p0(v1):    70     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 5.1e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    72.67        0

facet p3 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p3 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:        70        76  difference=    6
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 5.1e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image 2501_300kx_1nm_clhaadf3_0038_6: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 211654061  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  5  Error-roundoff 5.3e-14  _one-merge 2.6e-13
  _near-inside 1.3e-12  Visible-distance 1.1e-13  U-max-coplanar 1.1e-13
  Width-outside 2.1e-13  _wide-facet 6.4e-13  _maxoutside 3.2e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3):    75     0
- p5(v2):    79     0
- p0(v1):    74     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 5.3e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point       76        0

facet p5 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p5 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:        74        79  difference=    5
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 5.3e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image grid1_roi1_500kx_0p5nm_haadf1_0007_15: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 218830650  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width 18  Error-roundoff 1.1e-13  _one-merge 5.4e-13

  Width-outside 4.3e-13  _wide-facet 1.3e-12  _maxoutside 6.4e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 1.4e+02     0
- p18(v2): 1.6e+02     0
- p0(v1): 1.4e+02     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 1.1e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    148.3        0

facet p18 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p18 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       142       160  difference=   18
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 1.1e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image grid1_roi1_500kx_0p5nm_haadf1_0007_15: QH6013 qhull input error: input is less than 2-dimensional since all points have the same x coordinate    0

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3):    95     0
- p6(v2): 1e+02     0
- p0(v1):    94     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 6.7e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    96.33        0

facet p6 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p6 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:        94       100  difference=    6
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 6.7e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image grid1_roi2_500kx_0p5nm_haadf1_0051_13: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 221250858  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  3  Error-roundoff 4.4e-14  _one-merge 2.2e-13

  Width-outside 1.7e-13  _wide-facet 5.2e-13  _maxoutside 2.6e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3):    63     0
- p3(v2):    65     0
- p0(v1):    62     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 4.4e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    63.33        0

facet p3 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p3 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:        62        65  difference=    3
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 4.4e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image grid1_roi2_500kx_0p5nm_haadf1_0063_5: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 222679453  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  7  Error-roundoff 2.2e-13  _one-merge 1.1e-12
  _near-inside 5.5e-12  Visible-distance 4.4e-13  U-max-coplanar 4.4e-13
  Width-outside 8.7e-13  _wide-facet 2.6e-12  _maxoutside 1.3e-12

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 1.5e+02 2.6e+02
- p7(v2): 1.5e+02 2.6e+02
- p0(v1): 1.5e+02 2.6e+02

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 2.2e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    149.7      255

facet p7 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p7 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       147       154  difference=    7
  1:       255       255  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 2.2e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image map1_70kx_onzap_CL4100_1: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 223620645  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  2  Error-roundoff 2.2e-13  _one-merge 1.1e-12
  _near-inside 5.5e-12  Visible-distance 4.4e-13  U-max-coplanar 4.4e-13
  Width-outside 8.7e-13  _wide-facet 2.6e-12  _maxoutside 1.3e-12

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 2.5e+02 2.6e+02
- p2(v2): 2.5e+02 2.6e+02
- p0(v1): 2.5e+02 2.6e+02

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 2.2e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point      251      255

facet p2 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p2 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       250       252  difference=    2
  1:       255       255  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 2.2e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image map1_70kx_onzap_CL4100_19: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 223990399  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum

  Width-outside 4.6e-13  _wide-facet 1.4e-12  _maxoutside 6.9e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 1.7e+02     0
- p7(v2): 1.7e+02     0
- p0(v1): 1.6e+02     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 1.2e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    167.7        0

facet p7 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p7 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       165       172  difference=    7
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 1.2e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image 0501_300kx_1nm_clhaadf3_0014_24: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 226343379  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  3  Error-roundoff 7.7e-14  _one-merge 3.9e-13
  _near-inside 1.9e-12  Visible-distance 1.5e-13  U-max-coplanar 1.5e-13
  Width-outside 3.1e-13  _wide-facet 9.3e-13  _maxoutside 4.6e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 1.1e+02     0
- p2(v2): 1.2e+02     0
- p0(v1): 1.1e+02     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 7.7e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    113.7        0

facet p2 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p2 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       112       115  difference=    3
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 7.7e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image 2501_300kx_1nm_clhaadf3_0034_8: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 227721553  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  6  Error-roundoff 5.1e-14  _one-merge 2.5e-13
  _near-inside 1.3e-12  Visible-distance 1e-13  U-max-coplanar 1e-13
  Width-outside 2e-13  _wide-facet 6.1e-13  _maxoutside 3.1e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3):    72     0
- p3(v2):    76     0
- p0(v1):    70     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 5.1e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    72.67        0

facet p3 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p3 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:        70        76  difference=    6
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 5.1e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image 2501_300kx_1nm_clhaadf3_0038_6: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 228326605  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  5  Error-roundoff 5.3e-14  _one-merge 2.6e-13
  _near-inside 1.3e-12  Visible-distance 1.1e-13  U-max-coplanar 1.1e-13
  Width-outside 2.1e-13  _wide-facet 6.4e-13  _maxoutside 3.2e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3):    75     0
- p5(v2):    79     0
- p0(v1):    74     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 5.3e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point       76        0

facet p5 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p5 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:        74        79  difference=    5
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 5.3e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image grid1_roi1_500kx_0p5nm_haadf1_0007_15: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 235503194  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width 18  Error-roundoff 1.1e-13  _one-merge 5.4e-13

  Width-outside 4.3e-13  _wide-facet 1.3e-12  _maxoutside 6.4e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 1.4e+02     0
- p18(v2): 1.6e+02     0
- p0(v1): 1.4e+02     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 1.1e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    148.3        0

facet p18 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p18 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       142       160  difference=   18
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 1.1e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image grid1_roi1_500kx_0p5nm_haadf1_0015_17: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 236393965  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  6  Error-roundoff 6.7e-14  _one-merge 3.4e-13
  _near-inside 1.7e-12  Visible-distance 1.3e-13  U-max-coplanar 1.3e-13
  Width-outside 2.7e-13  _wide-facet 8e-13  _maxoutside 4e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3):    95     0
- p6(v2): 1e+02     0
- p0(v1):    94     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 6.7e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    96.33        0

facet p6 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p6 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:        94       100  difference=    6
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 6.7e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image grid1_roi2_500kx_0p5nm_haadf1_0051_13: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 237889788  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  3  Error-roundoff 4.4e-14  _one-merge 2.2e-13

  Width-outside 1.7e-13  _wide-facet 5.2e-13  _maxoutside 2.6e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3):    63     0
- p3(v2):    65     0
- p0(v1):    62     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 4.4e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    63.33        0

facet p3 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p3 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:        62        65  difference=    3
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 4.4e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image grid1_roi2_500kx_0p5nm_haadf1_0063_5: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 239335190  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  7  Error-roundoff 2.2e-13  _one-merge 1.1e-12
  _near-inside 5.5e-12  Visible-distance 4.4e-13  U-max-coplanar 4.4e-13
  Width-outside 8.7e-13  _wide-facet 2.6e-12  _maxoutside 1.3e-12

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 1.5e+02 2.6e+02
- p7(v2): 1.5e+02 2.6e+02
- p0(v1): 1.5e+02 2.6e+02

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 2.2e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    149.7      255

facet p7 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p7 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       147       154  difference=    7
  1:       255       255  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 2.2e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image map1_70kx_onzap_CL4100_1: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 240259575  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  2  Error-roundoff 2.2e-13  _one-merge 1.1e-12
  _near-inside 5.5e-12  Visible-distance 4.4e-13  U-max-coplanar 4.4e-13
  Width-outside 8.7e-13  _wide-facet 2.6e-12  _maxoutside 1.3e-12

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 2.5e+02 2.6e+02
- p2(v2): 2.5e+02 2.6e+02
- p0(v1): 2.5e+02 2.6e+02

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 2.2e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point      251      255

facet p2 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p2 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       250       252  difference=    2
  1:       255       255  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 2.2e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image map1_70kx_onzap_CL4100_19: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:

  Width-outside 4.6e-13  _wide-facet 1.4e-12  _maxoutside 6.9e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 1.7e+02     0
- p7(v2): 1.7e+02     0
- p0(v1): 1.6e+02     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 1.2e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    167.7        0

facet p7 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p7 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       165       172  difference=    7
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 1.2e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image 0501_300kx_1nm_clhaadf3_0014_24: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 242982309  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  3  Error-roundoff 7.7e-14  _one-merge 3.9e-13
  _near-inside 1.9e-12  Visible-distance 1.5e-13  U-max-coplanar 1.5e-13
  Width-outside 3.1e-13  _wide-facet 9.3e-13  _maxoutside 4.6e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 1.1e+02     0
- p2(v2): 1.2e+02     0
- p0(v1): 1.1e+02     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 7.7e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    113.7        0

facet p2 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p2 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       112       115  difference=    3
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 7.7e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image 2501_300kx_1nm_clhaadf3_0034_8: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 244982342  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  6  Error-roundoff 5.1e-14  _one-merge 2.5e-13
  _near-inside 1.3e-12  Visible-distance 1e-13  U-max-coplanar 1e-13
  Width-outside 2e-13  _wide-facet 6.1e-13  _maxoutside 3.1e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3):    72     0
- p3(v2):    76     0
- p0(v1):    70     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 5.1e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    72.67        0

facet p3 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p3 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:        70        76  difference=    6
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 5.1e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image 2501_300kx_1nm_clhaadf3_0038_6: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 245587394  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  5  Error-roundoff 5.3e-14  _one-merge 2.6e-13
  _near-inside 1.3e-12  Visible-distance 1.1e-13  U-max-coplanar 1.1e-13
  Width-outside 2.1e-13  _wide-facet 6.4e-13  _maxoutside 3.2e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3):    75     0
- p5(v2):    79     0
- p0(v1):    74     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 5.3e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point       76        0

facet p5 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p5 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:        74        79  difference=    5
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 5.3e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

computing distances is 1.1e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    148.3        0

facet p18 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p18 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       142       160  difference=   18
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 1.1e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image grid1_roi1_500kx_0p5nm_haadf1_0015_17: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 253705175  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  6  Error-roundoff 6.7e-14  _one-merge 3.4e-13
  _near-inside 1.7e-12  Visible-distance 1.3e-13  U-max-coplanar 1.3e-13
  Width-outside 2.7e-13  _wide-facet 8e-13  _maxoutside 4e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3):    95     0
- p6(v2): 1e+02     0
- p0(v1):    94     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 6.7e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    96.33        0

facet p6 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p6 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:        94       100  difference=    6
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 6.7e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image grid1_roi2_500kx_0p5nm_haadf1_0051_13: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt

  run-id 255402682  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3):    63     0
- p3(v2):    65     0
- p0(v1):    62     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 4.4e-14.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    63.33        0

facet p3 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p3 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:        62        65  difference=    3
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 4.4e-14.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image grid1_roi2_500kx_0p5nm_haadf1_0063_5: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 256932119  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  7  Error-roundoff 2.2e-13  _one-merge 1.1e-12
  _near-inside 5.5e-12  Visible-distance 4.4e-13  U-max-coplanar 4.4e-13
  Width-outside 8.7e-13  _wide-facet 2.6e-12  _maxoutside 1.3e-12

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 1.5e+02 2.6e+02
- p7(v2): 1.5e+02 2.6e+02
- p0(v1): 1.5e+02 2.6e+02

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 2.2e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    149.7      255

facet p7 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p7 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       147       154  difference=    7
  1:       255       255  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 2.2e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image map1_70kx_onzap_CL4100_1: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 257856504  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum
  _max-width  2  Error-roundoff 2.2e-13  _one-merge 1.1e-12
  _near-inside 5.5e-12  Visible-distance 4.4e-13  U-max-coplanar 4.4e-13
  Width-outside 8.7e-13  _wide-facet 2.6e-12  _maxoutside 1.3e-12

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 2.5e+02 2.6e+02
- p2(v2): 2.5e+02 2.6e+02
- p0(v1): 2.5e+02 2.6e+02

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 2.2e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point      251      255

facet p2 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p2 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       250       252  difference=    2
  1:       255       255  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 2.2e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.

Error in ConvexHull computation for image map1_70kx_onzap_CL4100_19: QH6154 Qhull precision error: Initial simplex is flat (facet 1 is coplanar with the interior point)

While executing:  | qhull i Qt
Options selected for Qhull 2019.1.r 2019/06/21:
  run-id 258209451  incidence  Qtriangulate  _pre-merge  _zero-centrum

  Width-outside 4.6e-13  _wide-facet 1.4e-12  _maxoutside 6.9e-13

The input to qhull appears to be less than 2 dimensional, or a
computation has overflowed.

Qhull could not construct a clearly convex simplex from points:
- p1(v3): 1.7e+02     0
- p7(v2): 1.7e+02     0
- p0(v1): 1.6e+02     0

The center point is coplanar with a facet, or a vertex is coplanar
with a neighboring facet.  The maximum round off error for
computing distances is 1.2e-13.  The center point, facets and distances
to the center point are as follows:

center point    167.7        0

facet p7 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p0 distance=    0
facet p1 p7 distance=    0

These points either have a maximum or minimum x-coordinate, or
they maximize the determinant for k coordinates.  Trial points
are first selected from points that maximize a coordinate.

The min and max coordinates for each dimension are:
  0:       165       172  difference=    7
  1:         0         0  difference=    0

If the input should be full dimensional, you have several options that
may determine an initial simplex:
  - use 'QJ'  to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'QbB' to scale the points to the unit cube
  - use 'QR0' to randomly rotate the input for different maximum points
  - use 'Qs'  to search all points for the initial simplex
  - use 'En'  to specify a maximum roundoff error less than 1.2e-13.
  - trace execution with 'T3' to see the determinant for each point.

If the input is lower dimensional:
  - use 'QJ' to joggle the input and make it full dimensional
  - use 'Qbk:0Bk:0' to delete coordinate k from the input.  You should
    pick the coordinate with the least range.  The hull will have the
    correct topology.
  - determine the flat containing the points, rotate the points
    into a coordinate plane, and delete the other coordinates.
  - add one or more points to make the input full dimensional.
